"<br/><br/>ross, by the way, these sorts of gadfly columns (""implausible"" speculations) that you are currently writing, similar to the one about how the two coasts should share more power with the flyover heartland, are good reads but ultimately fairly silly.   i'll take disfunction and gridlock or whatever malaise that comes with democracy any time, as i am sure douthat would too, over any kind of autocratic power.";negative

 instead of yet more prose arias denouncing the great villian, and blaming racism and the russians for his election, perhaps mr. krugman and democrats in general should try to address the economic crisis of the american working class  that moved these voters to support such a demagogic president. <br/>mr. krugman is an economist.;negative

 but its flaw in editorializing and reporting is not in commission but in omission of facts and points of view inconsistent with its brand<br/><br/>having a public editor may help in caching errors of reporting commission but is useless in protecting against the real problem at the times, errors of omission of relevant facts and observations that are inconsistent with the times' tendentious narratives.;negative

mr. bruni - trump's entire cabinet and leadership team is chock full of people with shoddy stewardship.;neutral
"it is astonishing the way douthat characterizes souter as a 'betrayal' rather than considering the fact that he was actually a non-political, non-activist, jurist who followed a rational judicial philosophy of *interpreting* foundational constitutional concepts under new conditions. <br/><br/>douthat *really* seems not understand what the court is suppose to be (indeed what the garland nomination was and the gorsuch appointment isn't)<br/><br/>and to simply dispense with the disgrace of last year with the simple phrase ""pocket veto""?";negative

 friedman and dowd have been recycling their own material for decades, and with the exception of leonhardt and spayd (by necessity) no new blood in years. <br/>and this column is yet another in a series of spayd offerings uninterested in issues of journalustic integrity, but which might as well be an offering from the times' pr department.;negative

bravo charles.;positive
  <br/><br/>i hadn't thought of the assault we are facing as one that is against a sense of community, but maybe krugman is onto something.;positive

 <br/><br/>please stop, mr. douthat.;negative

<br/><br/>today, mr brooks, you read like the 'crazy vicar' version of your self.;neutral
"  maybe mr. douthat should be reminded of that gospel quote: first remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's. i hope mr. douthat's next column is about all the ""consistently ad hominem"" (and worse) attacks being flung at the parkland survivors, and how senator rubio might earn some political goodwill by denouncing the hateful lies being spread about these grieving young adults.";negative

"4% (9/166) consider themselves ideologically conservative, while 12% (20/166) say they are somewhat conservative”<br/><br/>the 13k members also have a professional bias on 45s policies (hint: they don’t like them):<br/>•	on president trump's decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals<br/>•	on impact of president’s 2018 budget request on political science<br/>•	on proposed changes to visa applicant disclosure requirements<br/>ms. collins can opine on anything, but interjecting “expert surveys” is going for truthiness &amp; then it is fake news.";negative
paul: please never stop calling it like you see it.;positive
gail, console yourself.;neutral
mr. stephens nails trump's penchant for freudian projection.;positive
" they are deeply immersed in illusions and dream images; their eye only glides only over the surface of things … their feeling nowhere leads into truth, but contents itself with the reception of stimuli, playing, as it were, a game of blind man’s bluff …<br/><br/>mr cohen: to analogize trump's presidential actions to the reichstag fire is a game of blind man's bluff. shall we read how a great mind responds to the conventional wisdom of roger cohen?";neutral

 yes, brooks, will, beck, sykes, kristol.;positive
although bruni bemoans 'that' replacing 'who', he does it using one if my grammatical peeves.;neutral
mr. kristof,<br/>i look forward to your articles for many reasons, but chief among them is your admirable attempt to remain balanced.   they may be decent men, but please, mr. kristof, do not extend your graciousness to men like mnuchin and gorsuch who do not belong in the positions to which trump has nominated them.;positive

thomas,   well said,  the individuals you name ought to consider what history will write about their tenure with the trump presidency.;positive
<br/>fight trump,yes,but don't turn the american<br/>people against you in the process and guarantee him a second term.<br/>mr.blow's approach, though it may feel good,<br/>is precisely what got mr. mr. blow's level of unbridled vitriol<br/>is truly repugnant and i am sincerely surprised<br/>that the new york times,which rejects comments<br/>from readers for far less rancor, allows it.;negative
i am not going to argue with paul krugman's assessment of the boilerplate gop agenda that trump has put forth instead of effective new non-swampian ideas.  first a significant portion voted for trump because they figured h would go along with congress and paul ryan.;neutral
"this article does a lot right, but brooks' characterization of nietzsche and ""nietzscheans"" is vulgar, one-dimensional, and unfair to the many influential and compassionate thinkers who owe a great debt to nietzsche's thinking.  david brooks, you should know better.";negative

another thoughtful, fact-based well-reasoned column by mr. kristoff that will go absolutely nowhere with the no-gun-regulations crowd.;positive
"kind of secondary to the main thrust of professor krugman's column, but it is important to emphasize that whatever does go wrong, the ""presidential apprentice"" is most likely to make it worse.";neutral
well written, david.;positive
  <br/><br/>somehow, mr. brooks wants to equate what he seems to think is excess on the part of anti-trumpers with the dangerous lunacy of trump himself.;neutral
thank you, mr. kristof, for standing up and speaking out.;positive
  david has the luck of being in a liberal city that attracts the best and brightest. <br/><br/>but that ain't america, david.;negative
<br/><br/>again, i agree with mr. blow, those currently occupying the whitehouse are a pack of thoroughly miserable human beings. <br/><br/>on the other hand, mr. blow offers some clear language about people who lie with solemnity.;positive
"i'll shorten the key sentence for you, ross: ""everything his party promised you  was a sham.";neutral
thanks for putting this controversy in perspective charles.;positive
<br/><br/>ross, your immodest proposals are a throwback to the past, but the scenario you seem to be engineering was fragile to non-existent then.;negative
excellent article david, but you really have to get out more.;neutral
""" cute turn of phrase, but completely misses the mark, as do mr. douthat's conclusions that we are entering a period of ""stasis.";negative
bret stephens is a smart guy but he's really failed to grasp the issue when it comes to risks from climate change and the effects of man made carbon gases accumulating in the atmosphere.;negative
 contrary to mr. douthat's assertion, the carrier deal is not a policy, it was a publicity stunt.  contrary to mr. douthat's assertion, the cabinet is not reasonably competent, and they are working toward common goals.;negative
i am thankful ross has surveyed most genres of pornography (excepting, apparently, tentacle) and still has the energy to steer the #metoo movement into the welcoming bosom of faith institutions renowned for respecting women and the concept of sexual consent.;positive
thoughtful piece by mr. brooks.;positive
paul, if you wanted expertise trump has it among his closest white house allies.;neutral
<br/>3) please protect us from gail collins's fantasy of hillary 2020!;negative
  sorry, david, but a lot of these higher costs are thrust upon middle income earners and the young.   david seems to shrug this off with the claim that this is only from taxes on the corporations and the wealthy.;negative
it is remarkable how many of the commenters are associating douthat's concerns over liberalism with the specifically post-war american version of liberalism and then get defensive thinking he is attacking their views.;neutral
brooks is correct in asking that students take more coursework in history.;positive
 and,i have always admired mr. cohen but now he is no longer the voice of sanity.;negative
"</a><br/><br/>now, why would mr. krugman state "" republican foot-dragging on chip,  isn’t about the money, it’s about the cruelty ? <br/><br/>here is one possible answer from a former public editor of the new york times<br/><br/>daniel okrent noted ""op-ed columnist paul krugman has the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes ""  <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.";neutral

ms. greenhouse's article seems a little silly.;negative
 you will be surprised at how many trump voters will start seeing things your way if you stop expecting an apology from them. <br/><br/>and, as krugman says, many of them will claim to have been clinton or sanders voters by 2018.;neutral
  mr. brooks implies that young marriages should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but others see our material/celebrity culture as the problem. mr. brooks, while often creative in his perspectives, rambles, but maybe it takes one to know one.;negative
<br/><br/>so, mr. bruni has to turn on his mocking mode, which is ineffective at best and rumsfeldian at worst. frank bruni is good ( the best among nytimes columnists ) to read through trump's presidency, until.;neutral
"reading frank's column today reminded me of the expression: ""people don't know what they have until they don't have it.  more important to the story, frank took us on his journey beyond the overwhelming sense of loss, to accommodation, and after talking with people further down the road than he with a similar condition, realizing that with loss can also come gains in growth and wisdom.  <br/><br/>frank is superb writer, and today's column walked us through his frightening experience.";positive
 i might not like his decisions, but i understand them.<br/><br/>one thing david said was striking: “far from being a fighter, trump tends to back off when his plans face resistance, like during this week’s budget showdown. i agree with david’s assessment.;positive
ross, you have always argued for moral/religious underpinnings as a necessity.;neutral
 since that includes just about every republican candidate and office holder, i agree with mr. blow, that sliver of the nation is beyond the pale. <br/><br/>like mr. blow, i shut my ears to any politician who does not condemn racism, sexism and religious bigotry.;positive
mr. cohen says: “palestinian belief in two-state compromise has also eroded over the past two decades.;neutral
gee david, for such a mild mannered cherubic demeanor, you write like a lover scorned, a lover of democracy, and decency.;positive
 a pretext that paul even admits by his lambasting of trump’s and republicans’ agendas, and his admission that it’s all innuendo and smoke.  and we’re asked to forget the million words or more offered up by paul krugman and the editors of the new york times over the years, that are offered to this very day, for why republicans and in particular donald trump are the very incarnation of satan on earth.;neutral
"i regret not hammering at this point during the campaign, when exactly this amunition would've helped crystalize egan's message:<br/><br/>the 2016 election's context was the 2008 economic meltdown created by wall street turning our economic system into a ""casino,"" &amp; one in which the taxpayer would underwrite the banksters' wagers so in effect they could never lose.";neutral

  it's getting old, charles.;negative
january 16, 2018<br/><br/>the preservation of new york times readership begins and is forever with this king of article by dr. krugman - we know what we know and aren't afraid to tell it like it is -and so with a breath of insight we can recover from the avoidance distraction of life be for entertainment and free for all rage - but best as always we learn from history and then take responsibility for maturity in the citizenry as a pledge of allegiance to what is forever american truly the best for all  to be greater to the sum of the parts enlightening from cradle to grave then earned heavenly eternal life.;neutral

bravo brooks!  comment that incites meaningful debate.;positive
ms. dowd,<br/>you have a way with words like no one else.;positive
mr. cohen reads too much into the french election and projects changes to the european union which it is structurally unable to meet.;negative
 as roger cohen correctly states, it is too little, too late.;neutral
" ""<br/><br/>we'll see if david (and the rest of the nyt) follows his own advice.";neutral

derek black came to my mind while reading this piece, mr brooks.;neutral
<br/><br/>moreover, methinks mr. douthat needs to go back and read the constitution, and in particular the bill of rights, if he believes that a woman's bodily autonomy should depend upon what state she lives in, or a gay man's right to establish a family with whomever he pleases should be left to the whims of the majority through referendum.;negative

gail, i am in state of astonishment because the focus of the anger of those that voted to hc should be to the d establishment, yes, schumer and pelosi and their sycophants.;neutral
 as an ordinary citizen i would never challenge mr. brooks' erudite political insights.  mr. brooks, where were you then? maybe i missed it, but i have yet to see mr. brooks offer a full throated apology or even an acknowledgement that he was complicit in the rise of the republicanism that brought us to trump.;neutral
 face it mr blow, they fight dirty, they fight effectively and they are not effected or impacted by doing what is in america's best interests and more importantly the people's, for that reason they have outfought ust every step of the way and dominated local and state elections and made working class and economically struggling white americans believe that these tools of the uber rich are their saviors.;neutral
we are waiting for you, david, to give some answers to the last paragraph.;neutral
the profound truth in roger cohen's op-ed literally gave me chills.;positive

”  <br/><br/>brooks condemns facebook but fails to note that fb is only doing what comes naturally in an unfettered free-market system – seeking profit in any way possible, damn the social consequences.  <br/><br/>it’s what mr. brooks leaves out that thunders above his conservative flight of fancy.  but, brooks doesn’t mention capitalism’s refusal to honor the social contract as one of the subjects that didn’t come up in the zuckerberg hearings. and now - another chapter in: “the world according to mr. brooks.   just make up a story! <br/><br/>so put on a mr. brooks happy face! and have another glass of mr. brooks’ kool aide!;negative

a gallant effort mr. nicholas but i fear a waste of time.;negative
maureen,<br/>after so many plate appearances without a hit, it looks as though you have finally found a new swing, or a new bat.;positive
  douthat’s fantasy serves merely to mask that simple, damning truth. saying that obama’s executive order on dreamers was “smash-mouth” politics, and thus just like republican politics under trump, is both factually false, and precisely wrong in political and moral terms.  for all his pose of reasonability, douthat is a standard-issue republican in his projection of his party’s sins onto their political opponents. <br/><br/>douthat may sincerely want to believe that there is a rump of reasonable republicans, composed of people like rubio and ross douthat, who are an alternative to the extremists who dominate the republican and democratic parties equally.  his nominally anti-trump stance is really only a clever rhetorical sleight-of-hand, giving cover to republicans such as rubio who, as douthat admits, are basically all-in trumpists.;neutral

" your problem with trump david, as shown in your last article, ""the decline of anti-trumpism,"" was never about principle, it was that trump says racist things instead of using coded racist language as required by republican orthodoxy. democracies don't perish because of liberalism david; they perish when people like you discard democratic principles for racist right-wing allies.

 part of that strategy consists in doing what i have caught krugman red-handed doing -- calling the gop racist. re paul krugman's latest bashing of paul ryan: does anyone remember when krugman was a serious, honest liberal?  <br/><br/>i won't dignify krugman's vile charges of racism against the gop -- the umpteenth time he has told that lie -- except to point out that it is the democratic party that set race against race -- and identity politics generally -- to divide the country into warring camp for its own electoral profit.;negative
